        Description: Apply a unified diff to a file at the specified path relative to the project_path.
        (project_path is bound from the factory function).
        This tool is useful when you need to make specific modifications to a file based on a set of changes
        provided in unified diff format (diff -U3). If you are creating a new file, prioritize using `write_file`.
        If it is to modify the file, use 'write_file_with_diff' first. Use `write_file` as a fallback if applying the diff fails consecutively.

        Parameters:
        - path: (required) The path of the file to apply the diff to (relative to project_path).
        - diff: (required) The diff content in unified format to apply to the file.
